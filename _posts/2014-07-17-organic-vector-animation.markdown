![Organic Vector Animation](/content/images/2014/Jul/StyleTest.gif)


Hand drawn animation looks amazing. Last night, I wanted to see if  I could combine a few techniques I've seen out there to make a vector based animation that looks organic.

The above effect was done in AE using displacement maps, expressions, and particles. It's a pretty basic start, but I think it looks pretty convincing so far.

I really wanted to set up a system saves time so each trial didn't need to be animated individually.  The underlying blue blobs are perfect vector circles and their trails are procedural based on movement. The ideal goal would be to create a mock soft body goo system where the shape reacts to the environment.

Textures and shading are the next step, I will update this post with more tests as I do them.
