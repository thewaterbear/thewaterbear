A month ago, I retired my couch crashing days in NYC. A fond memory they most definitely will become. In their stead lies a new apartment on the Upper East Side which I share with my ~~girlfriend~~ (now fiance!) of 6 years. Crazy things all at once!

I also moved out of the co-working space I was working at, choosing to go with the apartment-office instead. While I do miss the awesome people (and animals) there, I have been much more focused with the new setup and projects are getting completed at an alarming rate.

Your workspace is really important, wherever you decide, make sure its the right place for you.

I'm pretty excited about life right now. There are so many things I want to do/build/make. I have a list on my computer of personal projects that is getting quite long....

I'll be posting a lot more :)
