Stumbbble is an idea I've had kicking around for a few years.


The other day I got an email that the stumbbble.com domain I owned was about to expire. I decided it was time to do something with it.


The site was thrown together in a single day using [sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/#!/), [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), [dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com), and [kimono labs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/).

It's not perfect, there are a fair ammount of bugs, but it feels good to build things and release tiny projects that have been chilling in the back of your mind. Hope you enojoy it.
