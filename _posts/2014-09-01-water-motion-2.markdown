####Process breakdown

The main technique was simply compositing layers and compositions full of effects while using many different blend modes. Everything was genereated inside after effects with lots of tweaking to make the motion look natural. Some of the effects I used include fractal noise, distortion, more fractal noise, curves, gradients, mir, particular, more distortion, 3D lighting, star glow, displacement map.
