This week I finally have some time to work on an update for Blur.

The biggest new feature in this release will be filters! This has been the most requested feature so we have been working on lots of sweet colors and textures that instantly make your blurs look much cooler.

Another side feature will be a split screen before/after. This split screen effect has been in the app since the begining as a debugging feature, but after playing with the new [Litely app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/litely/id850707754), their two finger touch implementation of this is perfect. Hats of to [@soffes](https://twitter.com/soffes) and [@colerise](https://twitter.com/colerise).

Here are some screenshots.
