For the past few weeks I've been building a tool to help freelancers do better at money. It links your projects to actual data from your bank account, so your project pipeline is never our of date, and your income is always tagged (for awesome analytics!) 

If this tool sounds interesting to you, let me know and I will work on releasing it for everyone :)
