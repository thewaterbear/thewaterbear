Here is design revision #347 for our first title from [@BuckLumberGames](http://www.twitter.com/bucklumbergames). It has gone through a bunch of changes, but as of right now it's going by the name Ryft and there is a 34% chance this might be what it looks like.

"Ryft" is a fully functioning game with a solid mechanic.  I would say it's best described as a minimalist, geometric, flow based, zen, pathfinding game. As soon as the visuals are presentable we will be posting gameplay footage.


According to the 17 or so people we have let play the game, it's unanimously fun. This is a rare thing for us. In the past, games we have made look great but are lacking in the fun department. It's exciting to already have a simple fun game that doesn't even have fancy graphics yet. Hooray for learning from your mistakes!

Here is a look at some of the latest art from the game as well as a theme song I put together. The theme song is intended to be ambient, exploratory, and zen like. Feedback is much appreciated!
