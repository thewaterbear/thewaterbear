I recently was commissioned to do a motion graphics piece for an upcoming tabletop strategy game called Factions.

The video will be launched soon along with their kickstarter campaign. In the meantime, here are some stills from the story sequence and one from the board game sequence.

Everything was composited, lit, and animated in After Effects. If you have any questions about process or technique feel free to [ask me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/davechenell)

Anddd a quick gif!
