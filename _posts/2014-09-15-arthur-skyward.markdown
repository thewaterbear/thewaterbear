About a year ago I started producing music. It started with my friends and I just jamming around on keyboards, drum machines, ipads, and whatever else made noise that we could get our hands on.

Since then I've spent many late nights deep in various music authoring programs discovering the complexities of crafting music.
I have lots of respect for the producers and audio engineers around the world who make the amazing things for our ears.

There is something awesome about creating when you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. I often sit down and start playing with no specific genre in mind and see where things go. I've made some truly horrendous music, but its an awesome feeling to discover a completely new medium and probe the boundaries yourself through trial and error until you find your own solutions.

Music is something that powers me. I'm listening to music 90% of my life. I literally cannot design/animate/code if there is no music playing. I truly appreciate all the artists who make music out there and I hope that one day I'm able to create something that will power someone else, continuing the cycle. That would be a nice thing.

I've made countless little beats, scores, and video game tunes; but this is the first full song I feel comfortable sharing with you, the fine humans of the internet. Perhaps one day it will be part of a full album.

Thanks for listening.
